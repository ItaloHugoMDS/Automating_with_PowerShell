# Automating with PowerShell  

The goal of this project is to automate the process of information collection for a team of Operation Center.  

The project consists of two scripts written in PowerShell (v5.1) which creates a series of folders, subfolders and files
in order to provide a organized way of storing day-to-day client information.  

The scripts can be executed anywhere in your system, and they don't require administrative privileges to run.

## How to use it  

First, you need to download the scripts by clicking in their following names:  

- [Setup.ps1][1]
- [Call.ps1][2]

The next step is to prepare your environment.  

As previously mentioned, the scripts can be executed from anywhere in your system. However, it is advisable to move them
to a specific folder or to your Desktop. For this demonstration, a folder within the Desktop area was created and it's
going to be used to store and run the scripts.  

1. Move the files to your desired folder.
